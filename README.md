# Project-Day-1 - Predicting House Prices 
This project provides dataset consisting of information about the location of the house, price and other aspect such as square footage.  The project aims to make a model which can give investors a good prediction on the price of the house.  We will use Linear Regression for this project and see if it give us a good accuracy including credit risk of 80% or anything above 85% is deemed good.

# Introduction
Predicting the future is especially problematic when the rapid pace of change makes it even more difficult to tease future trends out of current events. Long accustomed to gauging opportunities in the context of cycles, real estate investors now face a series of bewildering structural changes that will fundamentally transform how they operate in the future. The unprecedented upheaval caused by the coronavirus will inevitably shift priorities and perspectives. Perhaps most profoundly, it could change how we all think about physical space and how it is shared with others. Whatever short-term contortions the property market goes through in response to the economic devastation wrought by this virus, real estate investors should not lose sight of long-term changes in behavior. These will inform how people live and work in the future, ultimately shaping the types of developments that are most desirable in a world that will never be quite the same.  Nowhere is this truer than in real estate investing, where technology, demographics, climate, and affordability are just some of the factors quickly reshaping how and where people live, work and play. Investors and managers need to make increasingly complex calculations, weighing sometimes conflicting concepts such as density versus distance, affordability versus desirability and economics versus sustainability. Will secondary cities that have historically been overlooked but are attractive to dynamic young populations become popular? How will commercial real estate be affected by telecommuting and declining automobile ownership? Will climate change render waterfront property worthless or spur innovations that enable a different relationship to aquatic environments? These and many other questions are being pondered by investment committees worldwide.

# Motivation & Summary
Predicting the future is especially problematic when the rapid pace of change makes it even more difficult to tease future trends out of current events. In response, we cast as wide a net as possible, surveying the landscape for clues and triangulating our research by combining primary research, in the form of surveys and using interviews of fund managers and investors, with secondary research sources. Building an APP capable of providing;
