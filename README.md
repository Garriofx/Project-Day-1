# Project-Day-1 - Find A Home Made Easy
I have been increasingly disappointed by the lack of innovation in real estate technology. This project is about how to help the consumer make better decisions when purchasing a home. Potential homeowners can search and filter all the important criteria, from price to property type, location, transportaion, crime rate, recreation activities, and noise data, to help locate the perfect area. While this project is in no way going to reshape the MLS, I hope that it shows that, at least in a relatively simple way with limited functionality, that the digital tools for potential homeowners, both in a digital marketing capacity as well as when finding homes for sale, can be simple, useful and powerful.
